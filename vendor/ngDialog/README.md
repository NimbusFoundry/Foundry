# ngDialog

Modal dialogs and popups provider for [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) applications.

ngDialog is small (~2Kb), has minimalistic API, highly customizable through themes and has only Angular.js as dependency.

### [Demo](http://likeastore.github.io/ngDialog)

## Install

You can download all necessary ngDialog files manually or install it with bower:

```bash
bower install ngDialog
```

## Usage

You need only to include ``ngDialog.js`` and  ``ngDialog.css`` (as minimal setup) to your project and then you can start using ``ngDialog`` provider in your directives, controllers and services. For example in controllers:

```javascript
var app = angular.module('exampleApp', ['ngDialog']);

app.controller('MainCtrl', function ($scope, ngDialog) {
	$scope.clickToOpen = function () {
		ngDialog.open({ template: 'popupTmpl.html' });
	};
});
```

## API

ngDialog service provides easy to use and minimalistic API, but in the same time it's powerful enough. Here is the list of accessible methods that you can use:

### ``.open(options)``

Method allows to open dialog window, creates new dialog instance on each call. It accepts ``options`` object as the only argument.

##### Options:

##### ``template {String}``

Dialog template can be loaded through ``path`` to external html template or ``<script>`` tag with ``text/ng-template``:

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="templateId">
	<h1>Template heading</h1>
	<p>Content goes here</p>
</script>
```

```javascript
ngDialog.open({ template: 'templateId' });
```

Also it is possible to use simple string as template together with ``plain`` option.

##### ``plain {Boolean}``

If ``true`` allows to use plain string as template, default ``false``:

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
	template: '<p>my template</p>',
	plain: true
});
```

##### ``controller {String}``

Name of controller that will be used for dialog window if necessary.

##### ``scope {Object}``

Scope object that will be passed to dialog. If you use controller with separate ``$scope`` service this object will be passed to ``$scope.$parent`` param:

```javascript
$scope.value = true;

ngDialog.open({
	template: 'externalTemplate.html',
	className: 'ngdialog-theme-plain',
	scope: $scope
});
```

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="externalTemplate.html">
<p>External scope: <code>{{value}}</code></p>
</script>
```

##### ``data {String}``

Any data that you want to be stored in controller's ``$parent`` scope, it could be stringified JSON as well.

##### ``className {String}``

This option allows to controll dialog look, you can use built-in [themes](https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#themes) or create your own styled modals.

This example enables one of built-in ngDialog themes - ``ngdialog-theme-default`` (do not forget to include necessary css files):

```javascript
ngDialog.open({
	template: 'templateId',
	className: 'ngdialog-theme-default'
});
```

Check [themes](https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog#themes) block to learn more.

##### ``showClose {Boolean}``

If ``false`` it allows to hide close button on modals, default ``true``.

##### ``closeByEscape {Boolean}``

It allows to close modals by clicking ``Esc`` button, default ``true``.

This will close all open modals if there several of them open at the same time.

##### ``closeByDocument {Boolean}``

It allows to close modals by clicking on overlay background, default ``true``.

### ``.close(id)``

Method accepts dialog's ``id`` as string argument to close specific dialog window, if ``id`` is not specified it will close all currently active modals (same behavior as ``.closeAll()``).

### ``.closeAll()``

Method manages closing all active modals on the page.

## Directive

By default ngDialog module is served with ``ngDialog`` directive which can be used as attribute for buttons, links, etc. Almost all ``.open()`` options are available through tag attributes as well, the only difference is that ``ng-template`` id or path of template file is required.

Some imaginary button, for example, will look like:

```html
<button type="button"
	ng-dialog="templateId.html"
	ng-dialog-class="ngdialog-theme-flat"
	ng-dialog-controller="ModalCtrl">
	Open modal text
</button>
```

## Themes

Currently ngDialog contains two default themes that show how easily you can create your own. Check ``example`` folder for demonstration purposes.
